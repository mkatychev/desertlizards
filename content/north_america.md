In western North America, deserts form a continuous and enclosed series,
uninterrupted by major physical barriers, over a latitudinal range of 1500 km,
from southern Idaho and Oregon through Sonora and Baja California (Mexico).
Three distinct regions are generally recognized within this region: a northern
Great Basin Desert, a southern Sonoran Desert, and an intermediate area in
southern California and southern Nevada known as the Mojave Desert. The Great
Basin desert is structurally simple, with predominantly a single perennial
plant life form (low "microphyllous semi-shrubs" including _Atriplex
confertifolia_ and _Artemesia tridentata_). Vertical heterogeneity is minimal.
Because these small shrubs in northern deserts are usually very densely packed
and uniformly spaced, horizontal spatial heterogeneity is also low.

The Great Basin Desert is a very repetitive and rather monotonous landscape. In
contrast, the Sonoran is an arboreal desert with several species of trees and,
in addition to small semi-shrubs such as _Atriplex_, many large woody shrubs
(the most conspicuous of which is creosote bush, _Larrea divaricata_). As a
result, the vertical component of spatial heterogeneity is considerably greater
than it is in the Great Basin Desert. The Mojave Desert is also dominated by
_Larrea_, but is virtually treeless, except for a few _Yucca brevifolia_
"trees." The diversity of different plant life forms reaches an apex in the
Sonoran Desert. The addition of perennial plant life forms in southern U.S.
deserts is often accompanied by fewer plant individuals per unit area and much
greater horizontal heterogeneity in their distribution in space. Rivulets and
dry washes along bajadas are lined with different species of plants than
intervening areas.

Saurofaunas in the flatland deserts of western North America consist of a basic
"core" set of four ubiquitous species (the whiptail _Aspidoscelis_ (formerly
_Cnemidophorus_) _tigris_, the side-blotched lizard _Uta stansburiana_, the
leopard lizard _Gambelia wislizeni_, and the desert horned lizard _Phrynosoma
platyrhinos_) to which various combinations of other species are added, with
the total number of species increasing from 4 or 5 in the north to 9-10 in the
south ([Pianka 1967](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/NAlizdiv.pdf)).
Three Great Basin areas were studied (areas G, I, and L), four sites were
selected in the Mojave Desert (areas M, P, S, and V), along with a further
three Sonoran sites (areas C, T, and W). Incidental observations were also made
at two Sonoran desert sites in northern Mexico (areas A and B). North American
fieldwork was undertaken primarily during 1962 through 1964, but a few
observations were also made in Mexico during the summers of 1966 and 1969.
Censuses of North American lizards collected on each of these study sites were
compiled, as follows.

Some North American study sites have been encroached upon by urbanization
and several no longer support  any lizards (e.g., Mojave, 29 Palms and Casa
Grande). All North American lizard specimens are lodged in the Los Angeles

# North American Datasets

 My Ph. D. research took place in the early 1960's when data were entered on to
 mainframe computers using punched 80 column computer cards. I wrote my own
 programs to analyze these data. Information on each individual lizard was
 input on two 80 column fields using a continuation card, with study site, a
 unique specimen ID number, species identity, sex, date, time of collection,
 length of fat bodies, gonad condition (testis lengths for males, number of
 eggs and average egg diameter for females), weight, fresh field-measured
 snout-vent length, fresh tail length, tail condition, body temperature,
 ambient air temperature at chest height, where the lizard was when first
 sighted, where it ran to, how many times it ran, total number of prey items
 and total volume of prey in the stomach. Items in stomach contents were scored
 by number and volume using the above-mentioned 20 basic prey categories. These
 data files for almost 4,000 lizards were originally in simple text file
 format, they have been converted into files with a single line of data for
 each individual lizard. Most of my information on North American lizards has
 now been imported into mySQL tables -- I have written queries to extract
 various subsets of information, such as diets by species and sex, study site,
 and time. However, much more can still be done. For example, sex has been
 cross-linked accurately to separate data sets with preserved morphometrics to
 allow analyses of sexual dimorphisms in anatomy, thermal relations, diet and
 microhabitat.

### Data for almost 4,000 North American lizards are summarized in seven CSV files:

* [`NAall.csv`](NAall.csv)
* [`NAkey.csv`](NAkey.csv)
* [`NAanat.csv`](NAanat.csv)
* [`NAdiet.csv`](NAdiet.csv)
* [`NAdietfreq.csv`](NAdietfreq.csv)
* [`NAfemales.csv`](NAfemales.csv)
* [`NAtestes.csv`](NAtestes.csv)

Field notebooks were scanned and made into [pdf files](FieldNotes.pdf)

I also made up some prey size data files for North American lizards. All snakes
were collected and small mammals were trapped (these are deposited in the Burke
Memorial Museum at the University of Washington in Seattle). Bird lists were
also assembled ([Pianka
1967](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/NAlizdiv.pdf)).
