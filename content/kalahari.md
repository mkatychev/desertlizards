In the southern Kalahari, major physiognomic and vegetational changes take
place along an east-west precipitation gradient: the more mesic eastern region
consists of flat sandplains with a savanna-like vegetation, whereas stabilized
sandridges characterize the drier western "sandveld" or "duneveld." These red
sandridges, which average about 10 m in height, generally parallel the
direction of prevailing winds; sandridges are frequently as long as a kilometer
or even more and support a characteristic grassy dune vegetation. Interdunal
flats or "streets" average about 250 m in width, but occasionally may be much
more extensive, sometimes as wide as several km, with a vegetation consisting
of various grasses, laced with large bushes and scattered small trees. Two
common woody shrubs of Kalahari flats are Rhigozum trichotomum and Grewia
flava, both of which are vaguely reminiscent of the North American Larrea
divaricata. Detailed descriptions of Kalahari vegetation, with photographs, are
provided by Leistner (1967). Ten study areas were selected representing the
full range of habitats and conditions prevailing across the southern part of
the Kalahari ([Pianka 1971](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Kalahari.pdf)).


Average annual precipitation on four easternmost sites (designated areas D, G,
R, and T) is greater than 200 millimeters, whereas annual rainfall is less than
200 millimeters on six more westerly study sites (areas A, B, K, L, M, and X).
The latter six sites all lie within the "dune area" of the southern Kalahari as
delineated by Leistner (1967), and all have sandridges or sand dunes. Areas L
and K are within the former Kalahari-Gemsbok National Park (now known as the
Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park) and thus represent relatively "pristine" Kalahari
desert habitat (both areas support lion, leopard, and hyaena, as well as a half
dozen different species of antelope).

Four eastern sites are all on fairly flat terrain, but vary in their
vegetation: area G is a chenopod shrub desert with Atriplex semibaccata, area R
is a nearly pure Rhigozum flat, whereas area D supports a more diverse mixture
of small to large shrubs, including Rhigozum, Grewia, and the thorny bush
Acacia mellifera. Area T, in southern Botswana, is a mixed open forest and
savanna site with a substantial number of trees (this site was still quite wild
at the time of our initial study in 1969-70 with Spotted Hyaena, but with the
advent of bore water, it has since become cattle-grazing country); the savanna
and forest sections of the T-area can be treated separately as sub-areas. Most
Kalahari observations were made during the 1969-70 Austral season, supplemented
on a second trip in 1975-76. Most Kalahari specimens are lodged in the Los
Angeles County Museum of Natural History but the 1975-76 specimens are lodged
in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California at
Berkeley. From 11 to 18 species of lizards in five families were found on
Kalahari sites. Censuses of Kalahari lizards collected on each of these study
sites were compiled.

# Kalahari Data Sets

Data collected for each Kalahari lizard (_N = 5375_) in the field were as
follows: unique ID number, species identity, sex (if possible), ambient air
temperature at chest height in °C, active body temperature in °C, time of
collection, date, latitude, longitude, where the lizard was when first sighted,
and where it ran to, fresh field measured snout-vent length, fresh tail length
and condition, and weight in grams. All of this information has been digitized
and converted to mySQL Tables. Later, in the lab, lizards were dissected,
stomachs were removed and their sex and reproductive state was determined.
Protocols of these raw data sheets, one for five individual lizards, have never
been digitized, but were summarized by hand, and need to be entered into
electronic format and cross checked. In addition to using the same 20 different
prey categories that were used for North American desert lizards, another more
detailed Kalahari dietary data set identified termites to species and castes
based on 68 prey categories. Snakes were collected and bird lists were
assembled ([Pianka and Huey 1971](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/bio373/Koedoe.1971.pdf)).

Data for over 5,000 Kalahari lizards are also summarized in seven CSV files:
* [KL-All](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KL-All.csv)
* [KLkey](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLkey.csv)
* [KLanat](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLanat.csv)
* [KLdiet](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLdiet.csv)
* [KLdietFreq](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLdietFreq.csv)
* [KLfemales](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLfemales.csv)
* [KLtestes](downloads/Data/KalahariFiles/KLtestes.csv)

Kalahari field notes were scanned and made into pdf files ([Link to download pdfs of Field Notes](http://desertlizards.cns.utexas.edu/node/18/1009)).
I thank Ray Huey for invaluable assistance in curating these data.
