The great North American tall grass prairie -- we just took it and
turned it all into agricultural lands. We exterminated the bison,
wiped out the Indians, destroyed the prairie dogs and those
black-faced ferrets. We just erased an entire ecosystem. Now this
was very nice for Americans because that rich topsoil has allowed
us to grow lots of food to feed ourselves and the rest of the world
and we've grown fat and apathetic and miserable as a result of it.
We've lost the bison -- we've lost an awful lot that we'll never be
able to recover.</p>
<p>This essay is about an impending doomsday. I am going to take
you down, down, down and then I'll try to rise up with a little bit
of optimism at the end.<br>

width="150"> The great early American naturalist Henry David
Thoreau embraced wilderness and used a book as a metaphor for life
on Earth. Philosopher of science Holmes Rolston III extended
Thoreau's metaphor as the "vanishing book of life." Rolston (1985)
remarks "destroying species is like tearing pages out of an unread
book, written in a language humans hardly know how to read." This
book of life is disappearing before our eyes. Each page corresponds
to one of the many species of life forms that lived or still lives
on Earth, and describes everything one could possibly want to know
about its natural history and ecology, its parasites, prey, and
predators, how it is related to its closest ancestors, as well as
much more. Each chapter, in turn, describes how every member of
this myriad of millions of different microbes, fungi, plants, and
animals interact within a particular natural ecosystem. All of
Earth's once pristine ecosystems, past and present, are thus
described, metaphorically, in many volumes.<br>
<br>
The massive amount of information contained in all life on Earth
could never be recorded in a single book, or even in an
encyclopedia, but would require something more akin to many
libraries of Congress. This "Book of Life" is indeed the most
valuable of all of our many books, as it contains the entire
history of all life on Earth from its very beginnings 3,500,000,000
years ago. Unfortunately, this greatest book of all time is
tattered and torn, pages are missing, and entire chapters have been
ripped out. Humans are heedlessly destroying habitats, effectively
ripping out pages of the "Book of Life" even before biologists have
had a chance to read them. We are burning the greatest book for
nothing more than to expand the human population, which is already
precariously high.<br>
<br>
Most people consider biology, particularly ecology, to be a luxury
that they can do without. Even many medical schools in the USA no
longer require that pre-medical students obtain a biological major.
Basic biology is not a luxury at all, but rather an absolute
necessity. Despite our <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/anthropocentrism.pdf">anthropocentric</a>
(human-oriented) attitudes, other life forms are not irrelevant to
our own existence. We need them to continue to exist ourselves. As
proven products of natural selection that have adapted to natural
environments over millennia, they have a right to exist, too. With
human populations burgeoning and pressures on space and other
limited resources intensifying, we need all the biological
knowledge we can possibly get.<br>
<br>
We rely on other organisms for food, medicine, shelter, and
clothing. Simply put, humans could not exist without our symbiotic
bacteria, let alone without the endosymbiotic photosynthetic
chloroplasts housed by all green plants. Many of the genes that
drive our physiology and metabolic processes were invented billions
of years ago by microbes in Earth's primeval oceans. Even our blood
plasma reflects our ancient origin: it is very close to sea water.
We are but one small branch on the tree of life. We share most of
our genes with other organisms, including bacteria and fungi.<br>
<br>
Ecological understanding is particularly vital. Without
understanding natural ecosystems, how can we hope to manage
man-made ones wisely? Basic ecological research is extremely urgent
simply because the worldwide press of humanity is rapidly driving
other species extinct and destroying the very systems that
ecologists seek to understand. No natural community remains
pristine. Pathetically, many will disappear without even being
adequately described, let alone remotely understood. As existing
species go extinct and even entire ecosystems disappear, we lose
forever the very opportunity to study them. Knowledge of their
evolutionary history and adaptations vanishes with them: we are
thus losing access to valuable biological information itself. Just
as ecologists in many parts of the world are finally beginning to
learn to read the "unread" (and rapidly disappearing) "book", they
are encountering governmental and public hostility and having a
difficult time finding support.<br>
<br>
Let us consider the book of life: Several questions come to mind --
Can we read it? Will we be allowed to try to read it? Do we have
time enough left to read it? I have been very fortunate to have
spent most of my life studying the ecology of desert lizards. I'm
finding that I am no longer allowed to do things that I used to be
able to do because as we have taken over habitats and imperiled
other species, they have become so scarce that they must be
protected. I worry that before too long ecologists won't be allowed
to touch a wild vertebrate. When this happens, time will have run
out for us.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest enemies we face is anthropocentrism. This is
that common human attitude that everything on this earth was put
here for our use -- to be used any way we want. An example of an
anthropocentric human is a man with a chain saw cutting down a
redwood tree that's a thousand years old. That is audacity and that
is anthropocentrism and that is wrong. When you couple
anthropocentrism with technology and human greed, you get a
terrible monster, a rapist and pillager of Earth.<br>
<br>
I live in the hills about 35 miles west of Austin, Texas. It's
turned into a bedroom community for the city. All kinds of people
move out into the hills to avoid high city taxes in Austin -- they
bring their mobile homes, their security lights and their cats and
dogs so now there's a horrible, horrendous commute with new
stoplights going in everywhere.<br>
<br>
The city of Dripping Springs has had to build three new schools
because of this and it's turned into a little suburb of Austin.
Everything has gone downhill. When you meet your new neighbors --
usually over a fence -- they come up and say "Hi, who are you --
what are you doing out here?" I introduce myself, and they want to
know what I do -- how do I make my living? I tell them I'm a
university professor and a lizard ecologist and then I start to
plead with them.<br>
<br>
I point out that there used to be a lot of lizards and snakes
living in these hills and that they're all disappearing because of
this encroaching urbanization. I plead with them not to let their
cats and dogs run loose -- cats are born killers. They let dogs run
loose so they can "play" with the deer. Well, you can't do that --
dogs are wolves -- they pack up and they kill things. They don't
belong out there. Another thing people do is put out feeders for
birds -- that brings in urban birds -- blue jays that shouldn't be
out there replace the scrub jays that should be there. I've seen
rattlesnakes disappear completely.<br>
<br>
When I pleaded with some new neighbors about not letting their cats
kill lizards -- one of them made a huge mistake -- she looked at me
and said "what good are lizards?" She shouldn't have said that to
me . . .<br>
<br>
I looked her in the eye and said "what good are <u>you</u>?"<br>
<br>
Ecologists want and need access to wild organisms in semi-pristine
natural environments because these are the places in which they've
evolved and to which they have become adapted. Organisms don't make
any sense if they're not in their natural habitat.<br></p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/rattlesnake.png" width=
"450"></center>
<p><br>
Rattlesnakes . . . People often call me to ask where can they see a
rattlesnake. They don't want to see a wild rattlesnake; they want
to see one behind glass. A rattlesnake in cage might as well be
dead as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't have a natural habitat. It
doesn't make any sense. I don't know where it evolved or what it's
adapted to; I don't know anything about it.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>It's as if you took a a pair of scissors to a collection of the
world's greatest love stories and started cutting out the word
"love" every time you saw it and putting the little "loves" into
glass vials. You don't even know which book they came from, let
alone whether they are verbs or nouns, you don't know who loves
whom; love has been taken completely out of context. That's what's
wrong with animals in zoos. They don't have any ecologies anymore.
They might as well be dead.</p>
<p>We have to save the vanishing book of life, but we must also
read it. And my point as a biologist is that anyone can help save
it. There are tree-huggers galore out there and plenty of people
who just want to save the planet. Anyone can do that. But it takes
somebody who's dedicated and earnest and a little bit crazy to try
to go out and read it and try to make sense of it. That's what we
should do if we have the skills and motivation to do it. We should
try to read it before it's gone. I don't see any point in trying to
save anything unless biologists are allowed access to it. I think
that is a critical point here.<br>
<br>
Today we have many powerful tools to help us decipher the vanishing
book, most of which were unavailable a few decades ago. These
include air travel, email, fax machines, the global positioning
system (GPS), satellite imagery, geographic information systems
(GIS), the polymerase chain reaction (PCR, which allows
amplification of DNA), DNA sequencing, powerful personal desktop
computers and imaginative powerful software. Unfortunately, just as
ecologists have gained access to this vast array of new
technological tools, the very stuff we need to study is
disappearing.<br>
<br>
Some of these things might not seem very new, but I remember when
faxes first came out -- I was doing field work in Australia and I
wanted to send something to my university in Austin, Texas, and I
had access a new fax machine. As I was feeding it in down under, I
could see it in my mind's eye in now time coming out in Austin --
to me that was mind-boggling technology. I'm still hoping they'll
figure out how to fax me back and forth so that I can avoid the
plane trip.<br>
<br>
We've got technology now that is just out of this world. I started
using the Net before it was the Internet, before we had email, it
was called the Arpanet back then -- what I'm finding now with email
is that I can have colleagues anywhere in the world and we can work
really fast because if they're in Australia, when I'm asleep
they're working, and when I'm working they're asleep. We can work
24 hours around the clock, faxing and emailing stuff back and
forth, so our papers just come rolling out.<br>
<br>
I wish GPS had been around earlier because when I was out
collecting before lizards were gone from large parts of their
geographic ranges I had to record localities as "15 miles
north-northwest of Mojave, California," and I had to go to a map to
try to estimate Latitude and Longitude. It would have been so much
nicer to have a little GPS unit and been able to record these
things accurately; but it's too late now because we've erased big
chunks of information.<br>
<br>
I've gone back to several of my North American study sites -- they
were just crawling, literally teaming with lizards only 40 or 45
years ago, and now they are parts of little cities, trailer parks,
and not a lizard can be found. Collections I made back then in
storage in museums are really fossils. They represent what was
there before humans took over the habitat. To me that is shocking.
It makes those collections pretty valuable, too.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying I don't approve of conservation biology -- Of
course, we need it -- but I'm saying if you consider yourself a
determined conservation biologist, please, please allow biologists
access to the book of life. That's got to be one of the main
reasons for saving it.<br>
<br>
Conservation biology is a crisis discipline. It's an emergency and
it's a man-made emergency. We wouldn't need it if we hadn't ravaged
this Earth and taken over so much of its surface. Right now, humans
are using half of Earth's land surface. Currently, we are using
more than half of the available fresh water. We are now using half
of the solar energy that impinges upon the land surface of the
Earth. Worse yet, we have burned up fossil fuels that took millions
of years to form in a single century. That is shocking. One species
has taken half of everything for its greedy little self.<br>
<br>
In physiological emergencies, we must intervene so we resort to
surgery when somebody's dying. War is the equivalent in political
science. When you have an international political emergency, you go
to war. That's what conservation biology is -- it's a crisis
discipline -- it's man-made, just like war. We wouldn't need
conservation biology if we could control our own numbers. "Wildlife
management" is a pathetic joke, we humans cannot even control our
own populations!<br>
<br>
Conservation biology is actually more than just biology because it
bridges the gap to the social sciences -- we have to start thinking
in terms of the ethics of what we do with planet Earth. We should
have started thinking about it a long time ago.</p>
<h1><b>Problems in Conservation Biology</b></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognition and management of endangered species<br>
Restoration ecology<br>
Ecosystem conservation<br>
Ecological economics<br>
Environmental ethics<br>
Value of Biodiversity<br>
Design of Nature Reserves<br>
Minimum viable population size<br>
Genetic bottlenecks<br>
Population viability analysis<br>
Sensitivity analyses of Leslie matrices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a short list of some things conservation biologists are
concerned with -- they design nature reserves, identify endangered
species, help to prevent plants and animals that are teetering on
the edge of extinction from going extinct, and all sorts of other
things. And this is well funded in large parts of the world -- but
this is not basic ecology -- it is applied ecology. It's not
reading the vanishing book, it's simply aimed at trying to save
what little is left. Money has to be spent on that. Nature reserves
are only temporary holding places, as witnessed by the continuing
onslaught by big oil on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>When I was a little boy I spent hours and hours looking through
"Audubon's Birds of the World." I remember looking at the
photograph of the last Passenger Pigeon -- she died in a Cincinnati
zoo in 1914. And as a little boy I couldn't believe it, because I
read the text -- it said the sky was blackened with millions of
these birds flying over. And then I read further and found out that
humans in their greed went up to their nests and clubbed the babies
and pickled them and shipped them off to Europe to be eaten as
squabs. They did this for a few seasons and managed to stop
reproduction of this species and effectively drive it extinct in a
very short time -- a few years. Extinction is forever.<br></p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/PP.gif"
width="600"></center>
<p><br>
When I first went to Africa to study lizards in 1970, rhinos were
still fairly abundant and they hadn't been savaged by humans. There
are several species of rhinos and now all are endangered because of
a myth that came out of Asia that rhinoceros horns are an
aphrodisiac -- rhinoceros horn can be worth twenty thousand dollars
a pound. Rhinoceros are gone from most of their former geographic
ranges. In some areas, they are under 24-hour armed guard, and
would be poachers are shot on sight. The scales have tipped on the
relative value of a human life versus that of a wild
animal.<br></p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Rhinos.gif"
width="600"></center>
<p><br>
Powerful people convince poor people living in third world
countries that if they could<img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Viagra.jpg" width="200"
align="right"> get them a rhino horn they'll pay a thousand
dollars, which is more than the potential killer could make in
their entire life. Then the rich guy gives him a gun and if the
poacher succeeds, he buys it for a thousand dollars, takes it to
Europe or Asia, grinds it up and markets it for tens or hundreds of
thousands of dollars. Clearly, it's high time we switched to
Viagra.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/BisonRange.jpg"
width="350" align="left"> This is how we treat everything. Consider
the history of the geographic range of the American bison -- a very
beautiful animal originally found from Buffalo, New York, all the
way to Sierra-Nevada before the 1800s. Huge herds of untold
millions were quickly culled. People back then told about bison
thundering all through the day and all through the night. They
called it "prairie thunder." But that's gone for good, and you're
not going to see or hear it in your lifetime, and that's a loss.
When they built the Trans-continental Railroad, people would buy a
ticket and get a gun and load it with big slugs and shoot bison as
they rode across the continent, leaving their carcasses to rot on
the wide open prairie. As you can see, they split the bison herd
into northern herd and southern herd.<br>
<br>
General Sheridan said that bison hunters had done more to control
the American Indian than all the cavalry put together. We basically
starved out a lot of American Indians -- those that we didn't kill
instantly with smallpox and measles. Our ancestors practiced
genocide. We stole this continent from other people. We just took
it because we could.<br>
<br></p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Bison.gif"
width="550"></center>
<p><br>
I have a small herd of bison. They are absolutely magnificent
animals. My herd bull, Lucifer stands six feet tall and weighs
about 2700 pounds -- when Lucifer wants to, he goes over the fence
-- and when he does (I've never actually seen it), the earth must
shudder at this spot for a little while. His habit of jumping is
how Lucifer earned his name.</p>
<p>We have to get off our <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/anthropocentrism.pdf">anthropocentric</a>
high horse. Biodiversity has a value beyond how it can be used by
humans. Other Earthlings have been here longer than us -- much,
much longer -- and they have a right to this planet too -- that
includes wasps that sting you, ants that bite you, scorpions and
rattlesnakes -- it includes wolves and wolverines and all kinds of
animals that we have pushed to very brink of extinction.</p>
<p>I cannot discuss all the things that concern conservation
biologists but I do want to point out one that it is kind of
pathetic: we have settled on the minimum viable population size --
how low can you go and still have something -- to me, this is
tragic.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Vortex.gif"
width="650"></center>
<p><br>
One conservation biologist coined the term "extinction vortex" --
as we drive populations down, so that they get precariously low,
all kinds of factors come together to sweep them down to extinction
-- and all are man-made. We stole their habitat. We fragmented
their habitat. We've knocked their population sizes down to the
point where genetic variability disappears -- and, don't forget, of
course, climate change and toxic pollution. Quite simply, to other
inhabitants of Earth, humans are truly monsters.</p>
<p>We're more concerned now about toxic pollution as it affects
humans. It's causing cancers and feminization and all sorts of
other maladies. But we ought to be worried about it as it applies
to everything on this earth. And now, of course, people are
finally, finally now beginning to be aware that we have polluted
the atmosphere to the point that the entire planet is changing.</p>
<p>It's only a matter of time now until the climate changes really
drastically. Some meteorologists have models that show thresholds
("tipping points") where it shifts almost instantly
overnight.<br></p>
<center><img src=

<p><br>
About 10,000 years ago, we made one of our worst mistakes (<a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Readings/Diamond_WorstMistake.pdf">Diamond,
1987</a>) -- we invented <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/agriculture.html">agriculture</a>,
which allowed us to feed many more people and to reach
unsustainable population densities. We began to live in cities and
invented money. Food became a mere commodity that's bought and sold
-- greedy people learned how to make money on it. Most people lost
touch with the reality of where food comes from. When people go to
the supermarket and can no longer find <img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/deforestationUS.jpg" hspace=
"8" align="left" width="190"> Triscuits on the shelves they will
wonder "Where did Triscuits come from?" I fear that we will have to
become hunter/gatherers again pretty soon but Earth cannot support
very many hunter/gatherers.</p>
<p>One of the things humans do is deforest everything -- we cut
down trees to burn to keep ourselves warm, build boats or houses.
And<br>
<a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Deforestation.html">deforestation</a>
has been pretty thorough in many places on the planet. The U.S. is
fortunate -- we still have the luxury of trees because we got into
coal and fossil fuels early and managed to keep ourselves warm
and/or air-conditioned without cutting down too many trees. Still,
we have managed to cut down almost all of the original native old
growth American forests.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/3-Trees-Oasis.jpg"
width="280" align="right"><br></p>
<p>Out in the middle of nowhere in Northern Africa in the Sahara
desert is an oasis that had three big palm trees. It was called
'Three Trees' in Arabic. But somebody cut those trees down, so
although it is still on the map and it's still an oasis, but there
aren't any trees out there anymore. One cold night, a selfish human
cut them down and burned them to stay warm.<br></p>
<p><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Madagascar.jpg"
width="200" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;"><br>
Madagascar is one of the places that I want to go before I die
because it has so many endemic species -- it split off from
mainland Africa a hundred million years ago and it's got all kinds
of creatures that are found nowhere else on the earth. Yet, the
people of Madagascar are third-world, starving, over-populated,
eating everything. An endangered land tortoise in Madagascar is
highly protected on the world's list of "don't do anything to this
turtle," but they are commonly made into turtle soup by poor people
in Madagascar.</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>When humans first arrived in Wisconsin, a square mile was
forested with a little piece of prairie in the southwestern corner.
The prairie burned every year (prairie fires) and over the
centuries the prairie built up deep black top soils, which are
nourishing our nation today. The first thing settlers did was cut
down the trees as you can see. In a little over a century, this was
turned into tiny wood lots. Imagine the effects this must have had
on whatever used to live in that forest.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Borneo.gif"
width="400"></center>
<p>Here's an example from Borneo. This is what we are doing to this
planet. Wood has become extremely valuable and we're clear-cutting
anything that's left.<br></p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Fragmentation.png" width=
"450"></center>
<p><br>
One of the problems with habitat fragmentation is that you lose
core habitat. In that scene that I showed you from Wisconsin back
in the 1830s before humans got there, there was only a little tiny
bit of edge between the prairie and the forest. Cowbirds lived
along that edge. Cowbirds are brood parasites. They lay their eggs
in nests of other birds. Cowbirds used to be very scarce in North
America -- with habitat fragmentation, their populations have
boomed and the only place that small songbirds like warblers can
lay their eggs now to get away from these parasitic cowbirds is
deep in the forest. When only tiny little patches remain, a small
songbird simply cannot escape from cowbirds. Now cowbirds are very
abundant, small songbirds are heavily parasitized and their
populations are on the brink of going extinct because of our
clearing and habitat destruction and fragmentation.<br></p>

<p>Here is more testimony to our anthropocentrism and human greed.
This is the work of a Texas company called Freeport-McMoRan. They
have formed an alliance with Indonesian officials, and they're
taking gold and copper off the top of this mountain in New Guinea
(now part of Indonesia). They've stripped off most of the top of
that mountain and shipped it down the side in great big slurry
tubes that are ten feet in diameter to be sent back to smelters
where they extract the gold and copper. The ore goes down to the
sea where it is hauled away in ships.</p>
<p>You can see the damage this mining has done and is doing. It is
causing huge mudslides on the sides of the mountain and these are
polluting once pristine streams down below. Native tribes in the
lowlands of New Guinea lived off these beautiful, clear streams
with fish and crustaceans and food of all sorts -- now they can't
get anything because the streams are clogged with mud from dirt
from Freeport McMoRan's mining operation on top of the
mountain.</p>
<p>Some of these people being dispossessed by this greedy company
on top of the mountain broke into a supply shack and got some
dynamite and primers and they blew up the slurry tube. One of
Freeport McMoRan's CEO's complained that it was costing his company
a million dollars a day not to have that slurry tube open.</p>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan has been strip mining for ten years. They've
been taking a million dollars a day out of there for ten years.
And, when they have exhausted this mountain, no doubt they'll move
operations to the next one behind it.</p>
<center><img src=

<p>This is the scariest graph that you're ever going to see in your
entire life -- take a good look at it. We hit six billion not very
long ago and now we are at six and a half and we're still going,
roaring. This kind of exponential population growth is
unsustainable and has to stop. People sometimes ask "what is the
carrying capacity for humans?" As I stated earlier, humans now
occupy roughly half of Earth's land surface, consuming over half
the freshwater and using about half Earth's primary productivity.
However, lots of those people are living in poverty and not even
getting adequate nutrition. Many are just little babies, still
living under their parent's roof, who in a couple of decades, will
need their own houses and cars. A tidal wave of humanity is coming.
No politician will even recognize, let alone address, this enormous
problem.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to try to convince you that human populations must
be reduced. Paul Ehrlich, in the 1960s, wrote a nice little book,
"The Population Bomb," calling attention to this. Nobody paid much
attention to Ehrlich (1968). Even today, I hear people saying, "Oh,
I've heard you doomsday ecologists before. We've still got water,
there's no problem." They're so short-sighted.</p>

Consider China. How would you like to live there? Look at all those
little window A/Cs. They've got power, at least for now. Humans can
really be packed in. Do you want to live like a termite? Are we
termites? Come on, I want to be up on top of the hill where that
chair is and I want to have some space around me -- don't you? It's
a matter of quality versus quantity of human life.</p>

People are in a state of denial -- they simply don't want to
confront reality. We still allow people to have more than two kids.
We actually encourage reproduction. You get a deduction for having
kids. You should have to pay more taxes when you have your first
kid. When you have your second kid you pay a lot more taxes, and
when you have your third kid you don't get anything back, they take
it all. Our tax system is completely backwards. But, then, so is
our whole insane grow-grow-grow economic system. Earth and her
resources are finite.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife released caribou on the islands off
of Alaska to help the Eskimos, the Aleuts, get protein. Herds from
these islands grew exponentially just like the human population's
been growing for quite a few years until they ate everything they
could eat and then the deer populations crashed (Scheffer,
1951).</p>
<p>This is what's going to happen to us. This is going to happen in
your lifetime. Does that look like fun? Do you want to go there?
You've already gone there. We have waited too long.<br>

 Carbon dioxide is turning out to be a big thing that could really
spell out our demise sooner maybe than many people think or
realize. Big oil and governments don't want you to know about this.
CO<sub>2</sub> has risen steadily to almost double normal levels
due to our burning fossil fuels and cutting down and burning up
forests. This has caused <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Global-Warming.htm">global
warming</a>, and it's changing Earth's climates -- some even
speculate that it might be affecting things like earthquakes and
hurricanes. Of course, the more humans you pack in on the surface
of the earth, the more such events are going to decimate human
populations.</p>
<br>

</center>
<p>But, I'm a little more concerned about animals like polar bears.
Polar bears are big, warm and fuzzy -- the WWF cares about them,
and everybody thinks polar bears are nice and it would be a shame
to lose them. Polar bears require ice and ice floes. They're arctic
adapted animals, and as the ice floes melt, some people are
thinking that it might be the end of polar bears.<br>
<br>
And, of course, those of you that haven't thought about this will
say, "Oh, we'll just keep them in zoos with the air conditioning
turned way down." Let me remind you that they are not wild polar
bears; they are like the words "love" trapped in senseless little
vials.<br>
<br>
So, global climate is changing, and I come back now to Paul
Ehrlich. I said this was going to go down, down, down and I meant
it.<br>
<br>
Ehrlich in the 1960s said, if humans don't have the political will
to control their own population, microbes will control our
populations for us. Now I want to remind you of 1300 AD when the
"black death" swept down from China and one-third of the world's
population died.<br>
<br>
We killed off an awful lot of indigenous new-world people with
smallpox and measles. These were things that white humans in Europe
were adapted to because we lived with them, but the people that
made it across the Bering Strait could not cope and a lot of those
nasty microbes because of that. We're going to see this again, but
on a much bigger scale. Humans have been very very lucky not to
have experienced a worldwide plague for a long time, and one is
overdue.</p>

<p><br>
Microbes are small, and they reproduce very rapidly -- they have
generation times measured in minutes or less. They also evolve
really quickly, and we simply cannot keep up with them. We are
doomed. The microbes are going to get us. We are a great big
emerging substrate just waiting for microbes to grow on us. And
even though we are still <i>Homo sapiens</i> -- <i>sapiens</i>
means "smart" -- I'd say we're not. I'd say we're dumb because
we're letting our population grow just like bacteria grow on an
agar plate until they've reached the limits and used up everything;
and that's dumb. Humans are no better than bacteria, in fact, we
are just like them when it comes to using up resources. We need to
use our brains to ease into a sustainable existence, rather than
merely breed our brains out.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="350" id="_x0000_i1045" src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Ovenbird.png"></p>
<p>So, to try to convince you that populations are regulated, I
want to show you this plot -- a plot of the percentage change in
population size versus population density. When populations are
large, they tend to decrease and when populations are small they
tend to increase. If the slope of a regression line through those
data points is negative, populations are controlled through
population regulation.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Table.gif"
width="550"></center>
<p>That plot was just one example. The table above summarizes a
hundred-plus others. Most of these studies were done with birds.
Birds have been well studied, but a few invertebrates are also
included. To the right you see significantly negative regressions,
like the one I just showed you, to the left are positive ones. The
vast majority are negative, and half of them are significantly
negative.<br>
<br>
There is just one conspicuous exception -- far, far off to the left
-- one species among these one hundred and thirty-eight thinks it
can violate the rules of the natural world and that it can grow
indefinitely -- humans think they are so smart that they can defy
the rules. We are <i>Homo</i> the <i>sap</i>, not <i>sapiens</i>
(stupid, not smart).<br>
<br>
The Web is such a wonderful place. I thought, what would really
jostle the audience? And I thought of the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse, and so I typed that in -- somebody spent days painting
this for us.</p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Apocalypse.gif"></center>
<p>That's Conquest in front, then War, Famine, with Death bringing
up the rear. If humans don't go out in a blaze of nuclear
holocaust, or starve in a massive famine, death by a lethal
pandemic seems a likely prospect.<br>

Then I typed in "skull" and got this, complete with flashing red
eyes. Great, eh? Death awaits us all.<br>
<br>
Think about everything I've said and more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br></p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/T-cell.gif"
width="450"></center>
<p>This is an AIDS-infected T-cell of a human. Each of those little
round things is an HIV virion that can infect a new human.
Basically, this virus uses our T-cells as factories to make copies
of itself. HIV is a pandemic spread worldwide. It's increasing in
frequency in a lot of places and it's a big concern to everybody.
But, it's not going to be the one that gets us because HIV acts too
slowly, it lets us live several years while it passes itself on to
new hosts. HIV works too slowly to control human populations.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Ebola.gif"
width="450"></center>
<p>Now let's consider some other viruses -- <i>Ebola zaire</i>has
potential. It kills nine out of ten humans, and quickly, within a
few days. It's never gotten out of Africa because it is so virulent
it kills everybody before they can move. You can only catch
<i>Ebola zaire</i> by direct contact with a human who is infected.
It causes you to bleed. It breaks capillaries and you bleed out
your orifices and if you touch somebody who's sick with it you get
it and you die, too -- nine times out of ten.<br>
<br>
Another variety of <i>Ebola</i>, <i>Ebola reston</i> did get out of
Africa and into the U.S. in the form of green monkeys imported for
medical research -- it's named after Reston, West Virginia where
there is a quarantine facility for these monkeys. All the monkeys
died in an epidemic without any contact with each other. The
monkeys were sharing a common ventilation system in a room, with
recirculating air. All the monkeys in that room that breathed the
same air caught the virus and died. It was airborne transmission
between hosts. Luckily for us, <i>Ebola reston</i> doesn't infect
humans.<br>
<br>
Now it is only a matter of time until <i>Ebola zaire</i>evolves and
mutates a little, it will eventually become airborne, and then we
might finally see it spread. And if and when it finally does, it
will sweep around the world -- we're going to have a lot of dead
people. Every one of you lucky enough to survive will get to bury
nine. Think about that. If it isn't <i>Ebola</i> that gets us,
another virus will (<a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Nee2005.pdf">Nee,
2005</a>).<br>
<br>
Did you ever wonder why things like SARS and now the Avian Flu are
continually cropping up? They're arising because we were dumb
enough to make a perfect epidemiological substrate for an epidemic.
Instead of using our brains to keep our one and only spaceship
habitable, we bred our brains out and destroyed its life support
systems, and now we're going to have to pay for it. The microbes
are going to take over. They're going to control us again as they
have in the past. Think about that.<br>
<br>
Humans could have been stewards of Earth and all its many denizens,
microbes, plants, fungi, and animals. We have the ability to have
been God-like. Instead, for a short-sighted and selfish transient
population boom, we became the scourge of the planet. We wiped out
and usurped vast tracts of natural habitat. We ate any other
species that was edible and depleted Earth's multitude of natural
resources. In a single century, humans burned and wasted fossil
fuels that took millions of years to form. We fouled the
atmosphere, polluted the waters, and damaged all of our one and
only Spaceship's life support systems. The disparity between what
humans could have been versus the pitiful creatures we actually
managed to become is tragic and unforgivable. If only more people
would live up to their full potential!</p>

<h1>Part Two</h1>
</center>
<p><br>
Now, here's a breath of fresh air: Aldo Leopold (1949). This is the
start of the tiny little up. We've been to the lowest of the low
where the microbes are going to get us. Now, I'm going to try to be
a little bit more optimistic. Aldo Leopold was one of the first
conservation biologists. He was in wildlife management at the
University of Wisconsin back in the 1950s. Leopold died young, but
his children have put together a collection of his essays into a
small book, "A Sand County Almanac." I encourage all of you to read
it. Some of the things he describes in this little book bring tears
to my eyes. I mean I literally break down and weep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Leopold.gif" width=
"650"></center>
<p>One of the profound things Aldo Leopold said was that each
generation doesn't even know what has been lost -- only previous
generations remember. "Perhaps our grandsons, having never seen a
wild river, will never miss the chance to set a canoe in singing
waters."</p>
<p>When I was a boy, I could walk out my back door to a
semi-pristine creek and catch snakes and lizards. Kids these days
simply don't have that opportunity. There aren't any pristine
creeks anymore and they're living in cities, and that's
unfortunate. I became a biologist largely because of my exposure to
wild animals when I was young.</p>
<p>One of Leopold's statements was that we cannot continue to act
as conquerors -- we weren't given some God-given right to do
anything we want like chop down redwood trees -- we must have
respect for fellow inhabitants of this earth. We need to transcend
anthropocentrism. Other Earthlings have a right to this planet,
too.</p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Leopold2.gif" width=
"700"></center>
<p>This figure is from a conservation biology textbook, it's very
appropriate these days. Once we lived in small little tribes in
caves -- cave men kept around a few elders for their wisdom --
because they had lived through droughts and solved other problems.
For example, old guys might know how to treat a broken leg or some
illness. And, of course, medicine men and women specialized in such
information.</p>
<p>At the end of the Pleistocene, just 10,000 years ago, only about
500 generations before now, humans were hunter/gatherers, living
off the land in small bands or tribes. We had no electricity, no
cars, and no supermarkets, let alone fast food joints. We did not
live in houses, but found refuge in caves and crude shelters. We
hunted animals with spears, bows and arrows, and nooses. We caught
fish with crude nets and fish hooks made from sharp pieces of bone.
We gathered nuts and berries. We used sinew as twine and made our
own ropes. We had no jeans or shirts, underwear, or toilet paper --
we clothed ourselves in animal skins and furs, and wiped ourselves
with leaves. We had no television but sat around campfires telling
one another stories and passing on vital information from one
generation to the next (this was the origin of <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/SciMeth.html">human
knowledge</a>). Survival through the ice ages and winters in the
temperate zones was no easy feat under such conditions, requiring
substantial advanced preparation and food storage, as well as no
small amount of good luck.</p>
<img src="cavepeople1.gif" width="380"> <img src="cavepeople2.gif"
width="450"> <img src="CaveMen.gif" width="360"> <img src=
"Ice_Age_Animals.gif" width="470">
<p>Tribes probably defended territories against other small bands
of humans, but must have occasionally exchanged members. Our
primitive hunter/gatherer ancestors must have enjoyed a good life
during times of plenty in spring and summer when food supplies were
bountiful. There was limited "ownership" of such resources, and
people could help themselves to whatever they could find. Money had
not yet been invented and food was essentially free for the taking.
Many fewer humans dwelled on Earth then, and the planet could
easily supply their needs.</p>
<p>Things are very different today -- demand for limited resources
now greatly exceeds supply, and virtually everything is claimed as
"owned" by someone else. As their populations burgeoned, humans
invented agriculture and money, and made the transition from being
cave men and women to modern civilized urbanites quite rapidly.
Many of our behaviors and <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/HumanInstincts.html">instincts</a>,
once suitable for a caveman's existence, such as greed and revenge,
became anachronous, even dangerous.</p>
<p>We lived in little inbred groups and occasionally people would
move between caves but these family groups were little tribes that
battled over resources. That's at the bottom of this figure. We're
all familiar with selfish behavior in those small circles at the
bottom. We're all selfish and natural selection favors selfish
behavior. You can be altruistic towards your kin, as long as they
share genes that are identical by descent.</p>
<p>Cavemen tribes prospered, but now as we expand outwards to less
closely related individuals and to larger social groups, finally to
races or entire nations, altruistic behavior vanishes.</p>
<p>Look at the polarization in America today -- 50 percent one way
and 50 percent the other. We are not doing very well at cooperating
as we go outside of that tiny circle to larger and larger domains
such as dealing with people in other nations with different belief
systems. We need to engage in dialogue and communicate and change
each other's minds. All of us need to consider the health of the
entire <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/bio301/SpaceshipEarth.html">Spaceship
Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Going still farther out, you get to individuals of other
sentient species. Here I'm thinking of chimpanzees, gorillas and
orangutans. They're our closest relatives. They share our blood
groups. They probably can think. If one of those species had been
the lucky one to inherit the earth and evolve the big brain and
take control over everything else, how they would be treating us?
We might be in cages -- they'd be using us for medical experiments
and eating humans like we now eat gorilla "bush meat" in Africa.
Think about that.</p>
<p>Actually this goes beyond gorillas and apes to the entire earth.
Humans need to become responsible stewards of this planet rather
than remain mere conquerors and rapists.</p>
<p>Here's one more little upbeat thing, but unfortunately this
isn't very much of an up, Herman Daly has identified the big
problem, which is our <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/economics.html">economy</a>.
It's basically completely flawed. You've heard politicians talk
about "growing the economy." Our economy is based on the principle
of a chain letter, a pyramid scheme. That simply cannot work.
Upside down pyramids must fall over. Bubbles always burst and this
bubble is bursting.</p>
<p>It's bursting right now in terms of fossil fuels. The price of
gasoline isn't going to go down again. Some greedy oil men are
getting very rich from peak oil. We have institutionalized greed in
the form of limited liability offshore corporations -- if we do not
control runaway greed, it will destroy us all.</p>
<p>You need to hone your <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/survival.html">survival
skills</a>. On your way home tonight, stop and get a real tarp, one
that's made out of waterproof canvas. Don't get one of those crummy
plastic ones -- they deteriorate too fast. Start packing it with
the absolute necessities you must have to stay alive. These would
include things like needles and thread, a blanket, some sharp
knives, pliers and wire, water containers, some string, rope, and
twine, among other things.</p>
<p>I'm not talking toothpaste. I'm not talking about a lot of
things. Wrap them up and figure out how you can carry it on your
own two shoulders because you are not going to be able to take
public transport or drive your car when civilization finally
collapses. You will need to get as far away as you can from any
other human beings because they will take your stuff away from you.
Try to snare a rabbit, if there is still a rabbit out there to
catch. And, when you catch that rabbit, skin it and tan its hide
(learn how to use tannins to tan hides -- soon you'll be wearing
one!)</p>
<p>Our economic system based on continual growth must be replaced
by a sustainable system where each of us leaves the planet in the
same condition that it was in before we were born. This will
require many fewer of us and much less extravagant life styles. We
won't be able to move around so freely (airplanes will become a
thing of the past) and we will have to go back to walking and
riding horses. In addition, humans will have to be more spread out,
living without big cities. Before it is all over, we are going to
have to limit our own reproduction, un-invent money, control human
greed, revert back to trade and barter, and grow our own crops,
among other things.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Daly.gif"
width="450"></center>
<p>Let's get back to Herman Daly. He wants us to live in a
sustainable world, and he has the idea of an equilibrium economy.
Solzhenitsyn (1974) had the same idea. In an equilibrium economy,
every one of us would leave this earth in exactly the same shape it
was when we came into it. None of us are doing that. None of
us.</p>
<p>Mainstream economists think Daly is some kind of a nut, they
just ignore him. The economists that advise our political figures
have relied completely on grow, grow, growthmania -- impossible
voodoo <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/economics.html">economics</a>.
They place no value on wilderness and actually assume that
resources are infinite! Read Nadeau's "<a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Readings/Nadeau.Economists.pdf">The
Economist has No Clothes</a>".</p>
<p>So, if you have a leaning towards economics, here's a challenge
for you. Economics must be reinvented. Herman Daly published four
books on equilibrium, or sustainable, economics. Others must join
him. People must stop denying reality and
<b><i>think</i></b><span style="font-size: 18.0pt">. They can't
just keep behaving like sheep thinking resources are ever
expanding. We've got to realize that per capita shares of resources
are ever contracting, and we're running out of everything that
matters -- oil, food, land, clean air and water.</span></p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Meadows1.gif" width=
"450"></center>
<p>Meadows et al. wrote a book on some of this, actually, three
versions. The first one was commissioned by some people concerned
about the environment back in the 1970s. Dennis Meadows was the
first author and it was called "Limits to Growth" -- they developed
a systems model for the earth and its resources and how many people
the planet can support. They worked through various scenarios
including unlimited technology and many other things. Of course,
big oil and some fools still claim that we will keep finding new
supplies of oil and keep on going. I cannot understand people who
refuse to face the fact that the world is finite.</p>
<center><img src=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Meadows2.gif" width=
"450"></center>
<p>Notice the estimated population curve with a collapse -- things
are going to get better after the collapse because humans won't be
able to decimate the Earth so much. And, I actually think the world
will be much better off when only 10 or 20 percent of us are left.
It will give wildlife a chance to recover -- we won't need
conservation biologists anymore. Things are going to get better for
the other denizens of Earth as they deteriorate for humans.</p>

Technology lures us out on to thin ice. I learned this years ago,
when I got my first 4-wheel drive vehicle. Thinking that now I
could go anywhere, I soon discovered that you get stuck using four
wheels, too, but much worse than you can get stuck with two-wheel
drive (a Land Rover stuck up to its axles in deep mud is sad to
contemplate!).</p>
<p>Unlimited cheap clean <a href=

such as that so ardently hoped for in the concept of cold fusion,
would actually be one of the worst things that could possibly
befall humans. Such energy would enable well meaning but uninformed
massive energy consumption and habitat destruction (i.e., mountains
would be leveled, massive water canals would be dug, ocean water
distilled, water would be pumped and deserts turned into green
fields of crops). Human populations would grow even higher and the
last vestiges of natural habitats would be destroyed. Heat
dissipation would of course set limits, for when more heat is
produced than can be dissipated, the resulting thermal pollution
would quickly warm the atmosphere to the point that all life is
threatened, perhaps the ultimate ecocatastrophe. Read the <a href=

<p>In 1972, Meadows basically said, we better do something fast.
And, of course, like all of us who grew up in the 1960s, people
were in denial and nobody paid any attention. We just kept breeding
our brains out and ignoring it. Then in 1992 they wrote a second
book called "Beyond the Limits," in which they pointed out that we
could never ease back into a sustainable society, that we had
already gone too far in 1980.</p>

<p>Now it's 30 years later and, with his daughter, Donella, and
Jorgen Randers, Meadows has put out "Limits to Growth -- The 30
year Update." This is quite a depressing book because in every
scenario they run, humans must experience collapse. Collapses are
worse in some scenarios than in others, but we must face all in the
immediate future.</p>
<p>You are going to see it in your lifetime and the important thing
is this is just the beginning, this peak oil/peak food problem we
are experiencing right now. We aren't prepared for a what's coming
and we cannot avoid it. The future is coming up on you fast -- if
you are fortunate enough to survive, you are going to become a
hunter-gatherer. Get prepared for that.</p>

<p>Here's a graph comparing Earth's carrying capacity for humans to
our human footprint: the horizontal dashed line is the carrying
capacity and the solid black one represents resources used by our
actual population -- you can see we crossed the maximum level about
1980, and in 1999 we were more than 20 percent above according to
their estimate (it's probably at least 25% now).</p>
<p>This graph is overly optimistic because we could never have
reached six-and-a-half billion without fossil fuels. Basically, we
turned oil into food and food into humans, and we used the oil to
build highways and cars and take over and make this mess -- the
carbon dioxide pollution and all the rest. But now we're running
out of fossil fuels and haven't invested enough in developing
renewable resources, especially solar energy.</p>
<p>So this is really a very exciting time in the history of
mankind. Remember that ancient Chinese curse: "May you live in
interesting times"? Right now has got to be just about the most
interesting time ever and you get to see it. Hopefully, a few of us
will live through it.<br>

hspace="12" border="1"> I recommend Heinberg's "The Party's Over.
Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies" -- a chemist once
told me, "it's like we were on a luxury liner and we're on the
upper floor of the ship and there's a hole in it and it's sinking,
but everybody's having a big party up here, and it's just a matter
of time until we are all underwater." This is Heinberg's message --
he carefully researched all the facts. It's a doomsday book but
he's an optimist so he has this optimistic end where he lays out
what we can do, as individuals, if one is to live lightly on the
land, you know, lessen your footprint -- drive a Prius instead of
an Excursion -- it'll save you money -- ride a bicycle -- grow your
own food. He has all kinds of good ideas. Unfortunately, even if
you do all you can to minimize your own footprint on Earth, many
others won't. Cleaning up the trash along highways merely makes
things seem better and fosters litterbugs.</p>
<p>Educated people tend to have fewer children than uneducated
people. Garret Hardin (1964, 1998) pointed this out, and said those
who don't have any conscience about the Earth are going to inherit
the planet, because those who don't care are leaving more progeny
than those who do care and make fewer babies. And so human
conscience is on its way out, if we persist on our present course,
we're going to evolve into <a href=
"http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Uncaring_Humanoids.html">uncaring
humanoids</a>. That's probably already happening and cognitive
abilities are falling for the same reasons, too (Herrnstein,
1989).</p>
<p>To conclude, I want to quote John Stuart Mill (1859) to point
out that bright people have seen this coming for a long, long
time:</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot . . . regard the stationary state of capital
and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested
towards it by political economists of the old school. I am inclined
to believe that it would be, on the whole, a very considerable
improvement on our present condition. I confess I am not charmed
with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal
state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the
trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels .
. . are the most desirable lot of humankind . . . It is scarcely
necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and
population implies no stationary state of human improvement. There
would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture and
moral and social progress; as much room for improving the <i>Art of
Living</i>, and much more likelihood of its being improved" (my
italics).</blockquote>
<p>Mill wrote that almost 150 years ago -- it's basically a
statement about how a stationary world can be a good world. In a
stationary world you don't have to worry about bubbles bursting,
losing your stock, running out of oil, or survival kits. A
stationary world is sustainable and the world stays the same from
day to day.</p>
<p>We've got to reign in runaway greed -- we could live in a
stationary world as opposed to one that's based on growthmania
where everybody has to elbow the other guy and compete to get to
the front and be concerned about who's going to win and who's going
to lose every day in the stock market. In a stationary world, we
can focus in on things that really matter -- I love Mill's phrase
"the art of living." Let's get to work on improving the art of
living.</p>
